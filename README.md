## Introduction

In this project, I build a mini honeynet in Microsoft Azure and ingest from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace, which Microsoft Sentinel then uses to trigger alerts and create incidents. I was able to practice my incident response skills by following   the NIST 800-61 Incident Response Life Cycle framework, mitigating security events such as brute force attempts, privilege escalation and malware outbreaks. After some time, I measured some security metrics in the insecure environment for 24 hours, applied some security controls to harden the environment, measured metrics for another 24 hours, and then showed the results below. The metrics we will show are:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

## Lab Architecture
The architecture of Microsoft Azure SOC/Honeynet consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Accounts
- Microsoft Sentinel

## Incident Response 
This is an example of live alert tickets generated by Microsoft Sentinel:

Example  Windows Virtual Machine Brute Force Attempt Incident Response :

### Step 1 Preparation

In anticipation of potential security events, I directed all logs generated by Azure resources to the Log Analytics Workspace while concurrently configuring security alerts within Microsoft Sentinel.


A Custom KQL rules were set up to alert me for any possible brute-force attempts on my Windows virtual machine:

Essentially, what this KQL query is looking for are multiple failed log (> =5)  attempts from the same IP (Attacker) in the last hour. 


### Step 2 Detection and Analysis 

Upon further investigation, this alert was deemed a true positive.
The attack's origin, scope and potential impact were all discovered through a thorough investigation. 

### Step 3 Containment, Eradication and Recovery 

My remediation strategy was to lock down the Network Security Group (NSG), which was left open due to the nature of this lab and set up MFA.

### Post-Incident Activities

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were originally deployed and exposed to the Internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls wide open, and all other resources were deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internetâ€”aka, there was no use for Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic except my admin workstation, and all other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as Private Endpoint

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-03-15 17:04:29
Stop Time 2023-03-16 17:04:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 19470
| Syslog                   | 3028
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 348
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 843

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-03-18 15:37
Stop Time	2023-03-19 15:37

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8778
| Syslog                   | 25
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was constructed in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel triggered alerts and created incidents based on the ingested logs. Additionally, metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied and after implementing security measures. Notably, the number of security events and incidents were drastically reduced after the security controls were applied, demonstrating their effectiveness.

It is worth noting that if regular users heavily utilized the resources within the network, it is likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
